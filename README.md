## Hello
My name is Allan Pearl. I'm a 3rd Year computer science student, with an interest in low-level / systems programming.\n\n

I'm currently working on:
- [A CLI meal tracker program](https://github.com/jrjackx/simple_meal_tracker) with only libc dependencies, and\n
- [Text Editor From Scratch](https://github.com/jrjackx/my_kilo), an auxiliary project I'm doing to better understand low-level terminal input.

You can reach me at my email, allan.pearl04@gmail.com,\n as well as through my school email pearla3761@uhcl.edu
